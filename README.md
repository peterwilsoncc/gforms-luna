Gravity Forms CSS, Luna Edition
===============================

This plugin is an attempt to tidy up the Gravity Forms CSS.

Itâ€™s a subjective judgement, but many selectors are just too long. This makes them both performance and 
developer unfriendly.

I'm willing to bet that, with a filter or two, some OOCSS goodness can be added.
